# Social proof section
"Social proof section" is the task of creating a page layout on [frontendmentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io/?ref=challenge).

The page is a section with reviews from verified buyers. In the upper left corner there is a slogan inviting you to read customer reviews. Ratings from reputable publications are presented in the upper right corner. And at the bottom of the section there are customer cards with photos and reviews about the quality of service. To display the page on any device, adaptive layout is used.
